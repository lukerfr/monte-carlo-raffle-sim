This one is a little rough around the edges, but mostly finished. 

The first thing I would like to improve is the data, but the site doing these raffles does not publish any information about people entering the raffle, etc.
These parameters are estimatable with sufficient time and patience, but based on some tinkering with various strategies I decided my time would be better
expended elsewhere.

I might also change the graph to be a little more legible, maybe just eliminate a bunch of the intermediate values altogether, so it only
shows median/mean simulation, and highest and lowest for any given strategy.
